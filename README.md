# PRnet: Predicting transcriptional responses to novel chemical perturbations using deep generative model

This repository hosts the official implementation of PRnet, a flexible and scalable perturbation-conditioned generative model predicting transcriptional responses to novel complex perturbations at bulk and single-cell levels.

## Download model and datasets
We provide [model pretrained weight](http://prnet.drai.cn:9003/tcm/download/?file_path=/mnt/data/PRnetWeb/PRnet_model.zip) and precessed dataset ([LINCS_L1000](http://prnet.drai.cn:9003/tcm/download/?file_path=/mnt/data/PRnetWeb/Lincs_L1000.h5ad) and [Sci-Plex](http://prnet.drai.cn:9003/tcm/download/?file_path=/mnt/data/PRnetWeb/Sci_Plex.h5ad)) for training and reproducibility.

If the links above fail to redirect, please download the corresponding data and pretrained model weights from: [http://prnet.drai.cn/Statistics/](http://prnet.drai.cn/Statistics/). For the data files, download `LINCS L1000 Chemical Perturbations` and `Sci-plex Chemical Perturbations` from the `Supplementary Dataset` section. For the model weights, download the `PRnet model` from the `Supplementary Dataset` section. Then change the names of the datasets to `Lincs_L1000.h5ad` and `Sci_Plex.h5ad` respectively. If the dataset cannot be downloaded, please adjust your browser settings to allow insecure content on the current webpage by setting it to "Allow."

To clone our model, install github and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Perturbation-Response-Prediction/PRnet.git
```
Please download the datasets and store them in the `dataset` folder. Download the pretrained weights and store them in the `checkpoint` folder.

## Step 1: Installation
We recommend using Anaconda or Dockerfile  to creat environment for using PRnet. Please make sure you have installed pre-installation.
#### Setup the environment with Anaconda
We recommend using Anaconda to create a conda environment. You can create a python environment using the following command:

```
conda create -n PRnet python=3.7
```
Then, you can activate the environment using:

```
conda activate PRnet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Setup the environment with Docker
Alternatively, you can use Docker to set up the environment. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:
```
docker build -t prnet .
```
You can change the Docker image of PyTorch according to your cuda version in Dockerfile `FROM pytorch/pytorch:1.12.1-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime`.

Then run the Docker container:
```
docker run -dit --gpu all -v $(pwd):/workspace --name PRnet prnet
```
After the docker container is started, you can exit using `exit`. If you use the -d mode, docker will be placed in the background. You can enter the container through `docker attach PRnet`. After stopping the container, start the container with `docker start PRnet`. You also can use `docker exec -it PRnet /bin/bash` to enter the container. 

## Step 2: Test with demo datatset
Create result folders:
```
mkdir results
mkdir results/lincs
mkdir results/sciplex
mkdir results/demo
```

Inference with demo dataset:
```
python test_demo.py --split_key demo_split \
                    --data_path ./datasets/demo.h5ad \
                    --results_dir  ./results/demo/
```
## Step 3: Inference with custom datatset

Please see [custom_data_preprocessing.ipynb](preprocessing/custom_data_preprocessing.ipynb) to prepare your dataset. 'custom_data_preprocessing' is a demo which preprocesses the data from CCLE.

## Step 4: Train and test with provided datatset
To train the L1000 dataset:
```
python train_lincs.py --split_key drug_split_4    
```
To test the L1000 dataset:
```
python test_lincs.py --split_key drug_split_4     
```
To train the Sci-plex dataset:
```
python train_sciplex.py --split_key drug_split_0         
```
To test the L1000 dataset:
```
python test_sciplex.py --split_key drug_split_0       
```

## Step 4: Analysis the results
To analysis the L1000 dataset:
```
python analysis_lincs.py --split_key drug_split_4
             
```
To analysis the Sci-plex dataset:
```
python analysis_sciplex.py --split_key drug_split_0
             
```
